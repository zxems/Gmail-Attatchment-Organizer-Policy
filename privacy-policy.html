    <h1>Privacy Policy for Gmail Attachment Organizer</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: March 26, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Gmail Attachment Organizer is a Chrome extension designed to scan your Gmail inbox, categorize attachments, and provide a searchable sidebar archive for easy access. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data to deliver this functionality while prioritizing your privacy.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide its core features, Gmail Attachment Organizer collects the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Metadata:</strong> Information such as sender, date, and subject lines to identify and categorize attachments.</li>
        <li><strong>Attachment Metadata:</strong> Details like file names, types, sizes, and custom tags, stored locally to build the searchable archive.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Email Content:</strong> Portions of email bodies may be analyzed for AI-driven tagging (e.g., identifying an attachment as “Invoice”).</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> OAuth tokens, managed securely by Chrome, to access the Gmail API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The data collected is used solely to enable the extension’s functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email and attachment metadata are processed to extract, categorize, and display attachments in a sidebar.</li>
        <li>Limited email content analysis helps tag attachments for better organization.</li>
        <li>OAuth tokens allow secure access to your Gmail account via the Gmail API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All processing occurs locally on your device using Chrome’s APIs, and no data is transmitted to external servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>- Attachment metadata and the sidebar index are stored locally on your device using Chrome’s <code>storage</code> API to enable fast access and offline functionality.<br>
    - OAuth tokens are managed securely by Chrome and are not stored by the extension.<br>
    - We do not store full email content or attachments; these remain in your Gmail account unless you download them.<br>
    - No data is transmitted off your device, and we use Chrome’s secure APIs to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Gmail Attachment Organizer does not share your data with third parties. All data processing happens locally, and interactions with the Gmail API are handled securely via Google’s servers, not ours.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:<br>
    - Uninstalling the extension will clear all locally stored data (e.g., attachment metadata).<br>
    - You can manage permissions (e.g., revoking Gmail access) via your Google account settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about your privacy, please contact us at [your-email@example.com].</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the extension’s functionality. Any updates will be posted at this URL, with the “Last Updated” date revised accordingly.</p>
